//! # Quokka Polynomial Commitment Scheme
//!
//! This module implements the **Quokka polynomial commitment scheme**, a simple and efficient
//! commitment scheme for multilinear polynomials based on Pedersen vector commitments.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Quokka achieves **O(√N) commitment size** and **O(√N) proof size** for a polynomial with
//! `N = 2^ℓ` evaluations, where `ℓ` is the number of variables. This is accomplished by
//! viewing the polynomial's evaluation table as a square matrix.
//!
//! ## Construction
//!
//! Given a multilinear polynomial `f` with `ℓ` variables (where `ℓ` is even):
//!
//! 1. **Commitment**: Arrange the `2^ℓ` evaluations into a `√N × √N` matrix `M`. Commit to
//!    each row using a Pedersen vector commitment, yielding `√N` group elements.
//!
//! 2. **Opening at point `r = (r_top, r_bot)`**: To prove `f(r) = v`:
//!    - Split `r` into top half `r_top` and bottom half `r_bot` (each `ℓ/2` elements).
//!    - Compute `b = eq̃(r_top)` — the Lagrange basis coefficients for the top variables.
//!    - Prover sends `b^T · M` (a vector of `√N` field elements).
//!    - Verifier checks `b^T · M` matches the commitment via MSM: `⟨b, commitments⟩`.
//!    - Verifier computes `a = eq̃(r_bot)` and checks `⟨a, b^T · M⟩ = v`.
//!
//! ## Slight differences from project spec
//!
//! The project spec presents `Quokka.Open` with the verifier sending `(r, C')` to the prover first.
//! In this implementation, `r` is part of the [`Statement`] (since it typically comes from
//! a prior sumcheck), and `C'` is derivable from `r` and the commitment. Thus the verifier's
//! message is redundant and the protocol becomes essentially non-interactive: only the prover
//! sends a message.
//!
//! Additionally, the project spec's `Quokka.Open` returns the computed evaluation `⟨c, a⟩`. This
//! implementation instead takes a claimed evaluation in the [`Statement`] and verifies it,
//! which is the natural interface when used within Delphian.

/// # Algorithm
///
/// 1. Arrange the `2^ℓ` evaluations of the polynomial into a `√N × √N` matrix `M`,
///    where rows are consecutive chunks of the evaluation vector.
/// 2. For each row, compute a Pedersen vector commitment using the curve generators.
/// 3. Return the `√N` row commitments as the commitment.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `poly` - A multilinear polynomial in evaluation form. Must have an **even**
///   number of variables (so that `N = 2^ℓ` is a perfect square).
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A tuple `(commitment, opening)` where:
/// - `commitment`: A vector of `√N` group elements (row commitments).
/// - `opening`: Unused in this non-hiding variant (always zero).
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics if the polynomial has an odd number of variables.
///
/// # Example
///
/// For a polynomial with 4 variables (`ℓ = 4`, `N = 16`):
/// - The 16 evaluations are arranged into a 4×4 matrix.
/// - The commitment is 4 group elements (one per row).

/// Implementation of the Quokka opening protocol as an interactive proof.
///
/// This protocol proves that a committed polynomial evaluates to a claimed value.
/// Despite being framed as an "interactive" proof, it is essentially non-interactive:
/// the prover sends one message and the verifier checks it deterministically.
///
/// # Protocol Flow
///
/// 1. **Prover** computes `b = eq̃(r_top)` where `r_top` is the top half of the eval point.
/// 2. **Prover** computes and sends the vector-matrix product `b^T · M`.
/// 3. **Verifier** checks that `b^T · M` is consistent with the commitment via MSM.
/// 4. **Verifier** computes `a = eq̃(r_bot)` and checks `⟨a, b^T · M⟩ = claimed_value`.
///
/// # Why This Works
///
/// The polynomial evaluation can be written as `f(r) = a^T · M · b` where:
/// - `a = eq̃(r_bot)` selects the column contribution
/// - `b = eq̃(r_top)` selects the row contribution
/// - `M` is the evaluation matrix
///
/// The verifier cannot see `M` directly, but can verify `b^T · M` against the
/// row commitments using the homomorphic property of Pedersen commitments.
